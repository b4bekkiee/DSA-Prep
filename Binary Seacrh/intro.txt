Binary search is an algorithm used to find a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Its time complexity is O(log n), making it significantly faster than linear search for large arrays


finding mid = (start+end)/2 or 
avoiding int max min values 
 mid = s +(e-s) /2
